# about me!
## my role
I'm a DTSP apprentice at Sizewell C ([SZC website](https://www.sizewellc.com/)), a nuclear power plant currently in construction. I'm the Cyber Security Apprentice on site, and work closely with EDF Nuclear Services as well. I started working in September, straight after my A-Levels of Maths, Physics, and Latin. I'm based in Suffolk but I've recently travelled to both London and Gloucester for work and to meet new people. I'm excited to progress further in my role at SZC as well as my learning at NU London where I will be able to stretch myself further!

## my hobbies
I enjoy travelling in my spare time, especially to the Netherlands where my mum is from. I've also played clarinet for 9 years and cello for 7 years, reaching Grade 8 standard in both.
